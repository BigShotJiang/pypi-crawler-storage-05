  "version": "1.0.5",
  "summary": "The library is built as a subclass of Huggingface’s Trainer, tailored for encoder-style fine-tuning of generative transformer models on sequence classification tasks. It enhances the standard training loop with features like a dedicated classification head, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) integrated predictions, and label-balanced batch sampling. The framework also includes advanced callbacks for improved experiment monitoring and real-time notifications.",
